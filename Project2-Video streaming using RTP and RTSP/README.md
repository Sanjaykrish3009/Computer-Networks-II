# Video Streaming using RTP and RTSP

• Video streaming is a continuous broadcast of a live or recorded video from a server to a client.

• In file transfer protocols, the client must download the video in order to view it, whereas
video streaming allows the user to view it online.

• In this project, we develop this video streaming service using RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and RTP (Real time Transfer Protocol). More detailed information is provided in the report.
